Lyrics:

Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right

Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die

Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high.""

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in... again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

Like ____e got soul, but I__ not a soldier_ I__e got the will to fight, but I__ not a fighter. If anyone finds this comment, just remember you can always keep moving, hold your head high and hold on.<br><br>Edit: Still here! I&#39;d forgotten about this comment! haha. Life is still tough, but now I&#39;m sober. 2020 was a hell of a ride for me, as I&#39;m sure it was for a great many people. But I&#39;d like to thank you all for such a wonderful outcry of support and kindness. Sometimes I&#39;ve forgotten that we&#39;re all in this life together. Be kind everyone, and hold on!<br><br>Update Edit! 12/16/22:<br>You all have been so wonderfully supportive. You&#39;ve all kept me going to be honest. I kept going, I lived with my sister for 3 years and I saved every penny I could and bought my own home! Sure it&#39;s a used manufactured home, but it&#39;s mine. However, I paid cash so i didn&#39;t need a mortgage. Now I&#39;m helping out a friend at the end of their rope, and giving them a place to stay so they aren&#39;t homeless. There&#39;s no secret sauce to my situation, I was very lucky. I was frugal and things just happen to work out. But hold on, don&#39;t give up. Life can have some twists and turns you never saw coming.<br><br>Update Update! 2/27/23<br>Still getting a lot of positive comments, more than I&#39;d ever thought my little comment would ever get, more than I thought it deserved. You all still continue to be the most wonderful, inspiring, and supportive people. You&#39;ve all exemplified the very best we can be when we find those in the lowest of times. Life of course still throws it&#39;s curve balls, and they do hit hard. But now I&#39;m no longer alone with my problems, and I know I&#39;m lucky for that privilege. Stay strong, keep moving, and hold on to the ones you love, because those moments are fleeting...<br><br>3/3/23<br>Wow life does like a curve ball. I&#39;m in the metro Detroit area. In the past 5 days I&#39;ve gone from no power for 3 days to a furnace failure that lead to the discovery that my furnace is putting out toxic levels of carbon monoxide. The new furnace will set me back at the very least 3200. Coupled with rampant low staffing at my current job leading my emotional state being at an all time low. I feel like this song resonates more than ever, and how much positivity I&#39;ve received here. I&#39;m of course applying to other jobs. But i just once again wish to say thank you. It doesn&#39;t matter how small you think your comment may be, or think it means nothing. But it does. One comment may make a difference. I have felt alone for so long, I didn&#39;t know what healthy support looked like. Find that one shred of something that keeps you moving and hold on tight to it, It just may save your life<br><br>Edit 6/23/24. <br>I wish I had better news, but I don&#39;t. Costs have gotten insane for the house, even with a roommate and supplemental income im desperately sinking. All my savings are gone and I&#39;ve got far too much credit card debt now. I&#39;ve made the decision to sell it and move back in with my sister. <br><br>I have been sober from alcohol for 1 year and 3 months. A combination of weed and the help of a friend I was able to get off and stay off it. <br><br>I am still single. Been on a date or two last year but the stigma of living in a manufactured home in a trailer park did me no favors either. I&#39;ve fallen into a deep and dark depression. I quit my job because I couldn&#39;t bring myself to go (a retail blue box furniture store) and then the shame of not being able to work for being a pathetic loser and letting depression get to me. <br><br>I&#39;m at a loss. I thought I did all the right things. But nobody seems to want me. I&#39;ve never had a relationship last more than 2 months and I&#39;m just constantly ghosted on dating apps. I know it&#39;s partially me, I am a lot and I know it. But I am so touch and affection starved it is eating away at me. I literally don&#39;t know what it even feels like to hold the hand of someone I care about, nor have I ever woke up other than alone. I can no longer watch shows or stuff with romance in it because it makes me feel so bitter, the feeling of it being dangled in front of me as a reminder of (this is what you will never have). It&#39;s to the point I no longer feel like a salvageable human anymore. I won&#39;t give my whole life story but you can put the pieces together from my lengthy diatribes lol. <br><br>Thank you all again for your kind words. I come back here once and awhile, but i was too ashamed to update with bad news. Don&#39;t worry, this isn&#39;t the end. I won&#39;t do anything dumb but I&#39;m just so tired. <br><br>Tell someone you like having them around. You have no idea what it can mean to someone. <br><br>This will be my final update.', 'I&#39;m 57, have seen the Killers 3 times and absolutely love them so much!

Lyrics: 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up

Lyrics: 
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

Lyrics: 
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Lyrics: 
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Lyrics: 
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Lyrics:
Your blades are sharpened with precision
Flashing your favorite point of view
I know you__e waiting in the distance
Just like you always do 
Just like you always do

Already pulling me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

Let you cut me open
Just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don__ know why I__ hoping
For what I won't receive
Falling for the promise of
The emptiness machine
The emptiness machine

Going around like a revolver
It__ been decided how we lose
'Cause there__ a fire under the altar
I keep on lying to
I keep on lying to

Already pulling me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

Let you cut me open
Just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don__ know why I__ hoping
For what I won't receive
Falling for the promise of
The emptiness machine
The emptiness machine

I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part

I let you cut me open
Just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don__ know why I__ hoping
So fucking naive
Falling for the promise of
The emptiness machine
The emptiness machine
[I only wanted to be part of something]
The emptiness machine
[I only wanted to be part of]
The emptiness machine

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Lyrics:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

Lyrics:
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming. Confusing what is real
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling. Confusing what is real

Lyrics: 
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Lyrics:
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to 
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers 
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do 
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

Lyrics: 
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all
Over myself
To lick your heart
And taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we
Call it fall
I'll make it to the moon
If I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Lyrics: 
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, cause they
Will find a way to trip it
Everybody's looking for a silly gimmick
Got to get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's almost promising
This place was made on you

Tell me, baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me, lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where do you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brother's on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet
But life can be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Lyrics:
The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you gotta be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby

Why'd you only call me when you're high?
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""

#U2 #WithOrWithoutYou #Remastered

Lyrics:

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side.
I wait for you.
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait_ without you

With or without you
With or without you.

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you_

With or without you
With or without you.
I can't live with or without you.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you.",2019-07-15T16:42:36Z,-0.617961546058967,-0.27759874917840843,-0.3328969251543805,-0.4018066384994219,"['Lyrics : <br><br>See the stone set in your eyes<br>See the thorn twist in your side<br>I&#39;ll wait for you<br>Sleight of hand and twist of fate<br>On a bed of nails, she makes me wait<br>And I wait without you<br><br>With or without you<br>With or without you<br><br>Through the storm, we reach the shore<br>You give it all but I want more<br>And I&#39;m waiting for you<br><br>With or without you<br>With or without you, ah, ah<br>I can&#39;t live<br>With or without you<br><br>And you give yourself away<br>And you give yourself away<br>And you give<br>And you give<br>And you give yourself away<br><br>My hands are tied<br>My body bruised, she got me with<br>Nothing to win and<br>Nothing left to lose<br><br>And you give yourself away<br>And you give yourself away<br>And you give<br>And you give<br>And you give yourself away<br><br>With or without you<br>With or without you, oh<br>I can&#39;t live<br>With or without you<br>Oh, oh<br>Oh, oh<br><br>With or without you<br>With or without you, oh<br>I can&#39;t live<br>With or without you<br><br>With or without you', '__ith Or Without You_ is the definition of music.<br>\r<br>Lyrically, it is a song about the turmoil of a relationship, yet Bono__ powerful vocal and the instrumental of the drum and guitars are a match made in heaven.', 'This is the song that changed my life.

#U2 #WhereTheStreetsHaveNoName #Remastered
 
Lyrics:

I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside.
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name.

I wanna feel sunlight on my face.
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace.
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust.
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust.
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).",2009-12-14T11:57:43Z,1.131884259880025,-0.42633321550799197,-0.5320825283073859,-0.46342264517154297,"['When I was in Afghanistan in 2005 I played this song each time I went out to clear the roads for IEDs.

#U2 #IStillHaventFoundWhatImLookingFor #Remastered

Lyrics:

I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you.

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
(I was) burning inside her.

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one.
But yes, I'm still running.

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.",2016-10-17T16:00:02Z,-0.11750564556041528,-0.20190541686946578,-0.3077876987856776,-0.37312922965375495,"['ternyata lagu ini keren bangett  dan sangat mendalam makna dari lirik liriknya<br>sebuah pilihan yg tepat bisa dicover oleh Musisi Indo di semifinal AGT 2023 oleh Putri Ariani yg mampu menjiwai setiap lagu dan lirik liriknya', 'Thank you so much U2 for allowing Putri to sing this beautiful song in AGT __', 'Bono got an eye for talent!

#U2 #SweetestThing #Remastered

Lyrics:

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
Ours is a stormy kind of love.

#U2 #One #Remastered

Lyrics: 

Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now you got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life, when it's one need in the night.
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.

Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.
Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light.
We're one, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other... one

Have you come here for forgiveness,
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much, more than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got.
We're one, but we're not the same.
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again.

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law.
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.

One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should.
One life with each other: sisters, brothers.
One life, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other.

The program also includes extraordinary performances by The Who, Jethro Tull, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, Yoko Ono, and The Dirty Mac. A __upergroup_ before the term had even been coined, the band was comprised of Eric Clapton (lead guitar), Keith Richards (bass), Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience (drums), and John Lennon on guitar and vocals.

Led Zeppelin,rock,RlNhD0oS5pk,Led Zeppelin - Immigrant Song (Live 1972) (Official Video),"Official video for 'Immigrant Song' by Led Zeppelin. This version of Immigrant Song serves as a wonderfully evocative bridge between the early, understated Zeppelin of the Albert Hall era and the full-blown grandeur their performances would assume throughout the rest of the seventies. 

The visuals and the soundtrack of this live performance of are a digitized 'mash' of two separate performances: the film footage taken from the band's performance at the Sydney Showground in Australiam in February 1972; the music from a Long Beach Arena show, in Los Angeles, in the summer of 1972. 

""The fourth album had just come out and we were on a roll. Even though the visuals and soundtrack are from different performances, the energy that comes across is palpable."" - John Paul Jones

The Beatles,rock,LgR6UNeQxXE,The Beatles - Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds (Official Video),"""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles from their 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was written primarily by John Lennon with assistance from Paul McCartney, and credited to the Lennon__cCartney songwriting partnership. Lennon's son Julian inspired the song with a nursery school drawing that he called ""Lucy _ in the sky with diamonds"". Shortly before the album's release, speculation arose that the first letter of each of the nouns in the title intentionally spelled ""LSD"", the initialism commonly used for the hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide. Lennon repeatedly denied that he had intended it as a drug song, and attributed the song's fantastical imagery to his reading of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland books.

The Beatles recorded ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" in March 1967. Adding to the song's ethereal qualities, the musical arrangement includes a Lowrey organ part heavily treated with studio effects, and a drone provided by an Indian tambura. The song has been recognised as a key work in the psychedelic genre. Among its many cover versions, a 1974 recording by Elton John _ with a guest appearance by Lennon _ was a number 1 hit in the US and Canada.

Pink Floyd,rock,fn1R-5p_j5c,Pink Floyd - Welcome to the Machine (Official Music Video),"""Welcome to the Machine"" is the second song on Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here. The song is said to be inspired by George Orwell's book 1984, in which a man is trying to escape the government which is brainwashing its citizens with TV shows and oppressive rules.

The iconic video was created by Gerald Scarfe initially as a backdrop film for when the band played the track on its 1977 In the Flesh tour.

Pearl Jam,rock,MS91knuzoOA,Pearl Jam - Jeremy (Official 4K Video),"Official HD Video for ""Jeremy"" by Pearl Jam (Don't see the video in HD? Here are instructions on how to update video quality settings on YouTube: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/91449)

Originally released in 1992, the Jeremy video brought attention to gun violence, teen suicide, and violence in schools. The original uncensored video, previously unreleased, is being shown here for essentially the first time. The themes of Jeremy highlighted by Pearl Jam in 1991, have sadly only become more relevant in the intervening 30 years as gun deaths continue to increase. 
 
Pearl Jam continues its activism to reduce gun violence. You can support their efforts through re-released Choices merchandise and by donating to VitalogyFoundation:

Lyrics:
Hey, oh
Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did
All five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn
Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by
Some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So why do I sear
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
Round my head
I'm spinning
Oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away
And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures had
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see
All that I am
All I'll be
Yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky
But why
Why
Why can't it be
Why can't it be mine

I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me

Lyrics:

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your B.M.W?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call
Nobody could ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I've got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffin in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue

When she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call

LYRICS:

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth

Basically Cole rented out a house in North Carolina. It__ not for him; it__ like a safe haven/creative workspace for all the Dreamville artists and producers. We call it the Sheltuh, and a lot of the album was recorded there.. It__ basically a studio in a basement, in the woods. \r<br>\r<br>It__ also in the suburbs of a pretty wealthy neighborhood in North Carolina. So you have, predominately, African-Americans coming in and out of this house. Ubers coming, and every once in awhile you__l see a group of us outside on the porch smoking weed. So the neighbors started getting real paranoid.\r<br>\r<br>Apparently what happened was, we were all in Austin, Texas, for SXSW; thankfully no one was in the house when this went down. One of the neighbors told the police we were growing weed or selling drugs out of this house. And there was a huge investigation, like a million-dollar investigation. They flew helicopters over, sent an entire SWAT team armed with weapons, broke down the door and searched the whole house. Thankfully nobody was in the house. Our engineer Juro __ez_ Davis had just stepped out for lunch and he came back and saw the SWAT team busting down the door. \r<br>\r<br>They go downstairs and all they see is a studio, and obviously they felt stupid. It__ just crazy ironic because out of anybody, they picked the wrong person. J. Cole is the last person to do anything like that. He__ out here doing extremely positive things for the community and for young artists. Because of obvious racism from the neighbors, the police were called and a raid took place.', 'i find it ironic his neighbors helped him go platinum', 'Holy shit I got a huge sense of relief that no one was in that house that day, out if all the rappers that have died violently, if it happened to J.

Lyrics:

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
Baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it__ like a ghost town
Baby 
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that
Tired of beefing of bums you can__ even pay me enough me to react 

Been waking up in the crib and sometimes I don__ even know where I__ at
Please don__ play that niggas songs in this party I can__ even listen to that
Anytime that I run into somebody it must be a victory lap eh 
Shawty come sit on my lap eh
They saying Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store this isn__ a close able gap
I__e seen some niggas attack
And don__ end up making it back

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn__ last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it__ like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that 

I__ in the trenches relax
Can you not play that lil boy in the club cause we do not listen to rats
We in the line I buy her a wig she tellin me Tay is the best
Point at that nigga who act like a killer
But you only want from the neck
I__ like the baby I__ not just a rapper you play with me you gon get stressed
Ooooh
Bring Drake to the hood
Surround Drake around Drakes
Even though I got a case
Imma do what it takes

And I never been embraced
And the moneys hard to make
So I bet they on they face right

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn__ last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now
baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down
Baby
We took a trip now we on your block and it__ like a ghost town
Baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doing all this and all that 

When he tell the story that__ not how it went
Know they be lying 100 percent 
Move out the Ritz forgot bout the Bent
Valet just called to tell me come get it
I knocked that boy off  I don__ want no credit
If it Was me they wouldn__ regret it
left me for dead and now they want dead it
heart is still beating
My niggas still eating
The backyard it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with Me she spilling the tea and then shawty came back and said she didn__ mean it
Its hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib going crazy down bad what they had didn__ last Damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now

We took a trip now we on your block and it__ like a ghost town

Lyrics:
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet__nvasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
__ause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink MoâÂ´t with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell

""Big Poppa"" is a song by American rapper The Notorious B.I.G. It was released as the second single from his first studio album Ready to Die. It features a sample of the song, ""Between the Sheets"" written by The Isley Brothers. ""Big Poppa"" was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards. It also went on to win at the Billboard Music Awards.
The single was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold over 1,000,000 copies domestically.
There was an official remix released in 1995 featuring Jermaine Dupri, called ""Big Poppa (So So Def Remix)"" which has similar lyrics, with Dupri replacing Puff Daddy, and Biggie providing a new third verse. This remix appeared as a single.
The title is based on one of The Notorious B.I.G.'s many nicknames. The line, ""I love it when you call me Big Poppa"" is sampled from his verse from the Super Cat song, ""Dolly My Baby"" released in 1993. The song also samples the beat from The Isley Brothers' 1983 hit ""Between the Sheets."" It also makes a reference to the original Bad Boy artist Craig Mack, with the line, ""now check it, I got more Mack than Craig in the bed..."".
The music video was filmed in late 1994 and it was released for the week ending on December 11, 1994.

Official __ircles_ Lyrics

We couldn__ turn around
Til we were upside down
I__l be the bad guy now
But know I ain__ too proud
I couldn__ be there
Even when I tried
You don__ believe it
We do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame because we can__ let go
Runaway but we__e running in circles
Runaway, runaway
I dare you to do something
I__ waiting on you again
So I don__ take the blame
Runaway but we__e running in circles
Runaway, runaway, runaway

Let go
I got a feeling that it__ time to let go
I said so
I knew that this was doomed from the get go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes, the echoes
I got a feeling that it__ time to let it go
Let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame because we can__ let go
Runaway but we__e running in circles
Runaway, runaway
I dare you to do something
I__ waiting on you again
So I don__ take the blame
Runaway but we__e running in circles
Runaway, runaway, runaway

Maybe you don__ understand what I__ going thru
It__ only me, what you got to lose
Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do
It__ only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame because we can__ let go
Runaway but we__e running in circles
Runaway, runaway
I dare you to do something
I__ waiting on you again
So I don__ take the blame
Runaway but we__e running in circles
Runaway, runaway, runaway

Meet me at midnight ...
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don__ ever say too much
And you don__ really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I__ damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me
Is if I__ gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one night or a wife
I find it dizzying
They__e bringing up my history
But you weren__ even listening
Chorus
That lavender haze
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Chorus
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

__fficial __he Man_ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool
They__ say I played the ÃÂ¨_ld before I found someone to commit to 
And that would be ok
For me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 
I__ be a fearless leader
I__ be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What__ that like? I__ so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I__ get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I__ so sick of them coming at me again 
__ause if I was a man...
Then I__ be the man 
I__ be the man
I__ be the man They__ say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn__ shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I__ be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez Chorus What__ it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 
And it__ all good if you__e bad 
And it__ okay if you__e mad If I was out ÃÂ¨_shing my dollars 
I__ be a bitch, not a baller 
They paint me out to be bad 
So it__ okay that I__ mad I__ so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I__ get there quicker 
If I was a man
I__ so sick of them coming at me again 
__ause if I was a man...
Then I__ be the man 
I__ be the man
I__ so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I__ get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I__ so sick of them coming at me again 
__ause if I was a man...
Then I__ be the man 
I__ be the man
I__ be the man
I__ be the man
I__ be the man
I__ be the man
If I was a man
I__ be the man

Lyrics:
Every time you come around you know I can__ say no 
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
and tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won__
I__e got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can__ escape 
Nothing happens after two
It__ true it__ true
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Falling over everything to reach the first times spark
Started under neon lights then it all got dark 
I only know how to go too far 

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won__
I__e got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can__ escape 
Nothing happens after two
It__ true it__ true
My bad habits lead to you

We took the long way round
And burned til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won__
I__e got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can__ escape 
Nothing happens after two
It__ true it__ true
My bad habits lead to you

-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn__ the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I__l give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I__ singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don__ mind me 
Say boy let__ not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I__ in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I__ in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I__ in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I__ in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I__ in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I__ in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I__ in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We__e going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family__ doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don__ mind me
Say boy let__ not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I__ in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I__ in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I__ in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I__ in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I__ in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I__ in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I__ in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I__ in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I__ in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I__ in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I__ in love with the shape of you

Lyrics:
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then something more
Oh yeah I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Oh yeah I want it all 

You got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my souls on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah you got me feeling like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you__e close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance __il the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party__ over then we__l bring it right back
And we__l say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you__e close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance __il the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party__ over then we__l bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
 Oh I can__ get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and break my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Oh I can__ get enough

You got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my souls on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah you got me feeling like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you__e close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance __il the sunlight cracks

Lyrics:

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
I'm so fuckin'
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (so good with that)
She taught me love (love)
She taught me patience (patience)
How she handles pain (pain)
That shit's amazing (yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say
Thank you, next (thank you, next)

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (song is a smash)
I've got so much love (love)
Got so much patience (patience)

Cooking in the kitchen and I__ in the bedroom
I__ in the Olympics way I__ jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn__ do
That I won__ do, switching for 

Perfect, perfect
You__e too good to be true
But I get tired of running
Fuck it, now I__ running with you (with you)

Said boy I__ tryna meet your mama
on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love
on a Monday
Never need no 
No one else babe
__ause I__l be

Switching the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I__ in the bedroom
I__ in the Olympics way I__ jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn__ do
That I won__ do, switching for you

Lyrics:
Something's in the-

Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losing track of time
Like I don't really care right now, but maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you
I wondered if you aware that day was the last straw for me and I know

I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower and left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay, ay

Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it oncâÂµ was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

I used to think you were shy
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
So easy (so easy)
He-hee, mm-mm-mm, mm

Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd been gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
But you got no job
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw (think you're such an outlaw)
But you got no job

What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na
What did I tell you?

Lyrics:
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend but keep me closer (call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

The male producer/manager figure who tricks her into trusting him represents her first manager who SA&#39;d her which resulted in a pregnancy. She had to make the choice to terminate or lose everything she&#39;d worked for. She references this betrayal a lot throughout her career, but this is really the first time she clapped back. It was her big &#39;fuck you&#39; to him after she broke out and had solidified herself.<br><br>The transformation she goes through in the video, represents how she built herself back up after the trauma he and the industry as a whole inflicted on her. She fought back, clawed her way to the top &amp; made herself a star. The other girls laying dead around the grounds are his/the industry&#39;s other victims and she&#39;s getting revenge on her own and their behalf.<br><br>In the end, she plays him at his own game &amp; kills his career. So many other little hidden messages, as with most of her songs/clips. &#39;My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry - it don&#39;t have a price&#39;. Purple teardrops are a reference to drug use and sex with strangers   - both common themes of the music scene.<br><br>So much to unpack in a single song, it often takes me a long time to fully appreciate the little hidden meanings in her work.

What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don__ want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we__e running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You__e so indecisive of what I__ saying
Don__ want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you__e down and then between

Ohh I really want to know_

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we__e running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You__e overprotective when I__ leaving
Trying to compromise but I can__ win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won__ let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you__e down and then between
Ohh I really want to know_
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don__ want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we__e running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind

Lyrics:
(Snoop)
Greetings, loved ones
Let__ take a journey

(Verse 1)
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin_ gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

(Pre-Chorus)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You__l be falling in love o o o o

(Chorus)
California gurls
We__e unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We__l melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We__e undeniable
Fine fresh fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh

(Verse 2)
Sex on the beach
We don__ mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo oh oh
Pre-Chorus
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You__l be falling in love o o o o

(Chorus)
California gurls
We__e unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We__l melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We__e undeniable
Fine fresh fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh

(Snoop)
Toned tan fit and ready
Turn it up cuz it__ getting heavy
Wild Wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she__ the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl__ a freak, she drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I__ okay, I won__ play
I love the bait just like I love LA
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys bangin_ out
All that ass hangin_ out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies, just a king and a queenie
Katy my lady (yeah)
Lookie here, baby

Lyrics:
There__ a stranger in my bed
There__ a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a mini-bar
DJs passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I__ screwed
Oh well
It__ a blacktop blur
But I__ pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Then got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a mâÂ©nage _ trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke a law
Always say we__e gonna stop
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don__ know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I__ screwed
Oh well
It__ a blacktop blur
But I__ pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Then got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a mâÂ©nage _ trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke a law
Always say we__e gonna stop
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night

TGIF TGIF TGIF TGIF TGIF TGIF TGIF

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Then got kicked out of the bar

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark

Lyrics:
Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drain me down
That was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you__e not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you__e not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no

Bridge:
Now look at me I__ sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won__ never put me out again
I__ glowing oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don__ mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah yeah, except for me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no (away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you__e not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me (no)
(away from me) This is the part of me
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you__e not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you__e never gonna ever take away from me, no

LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Lyrics:
There ain__ no gold
In this river
That I__e been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope
In these waters
But I can__ bring myself to swim 
When I am drowning 
In this silence baby let me in
 
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn__ get the chance to 
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
 
There ain__ no room 
For things to change
When we are both so deeply 
Stuck in our ways
You can__ deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up 
 
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn__ even show

Lyrics: 

Opened up my journal to a page
Everything that hurts me__ still the same
Feels like there__ nothing new for me to say
Why why why
Why why why
Sweating through the sheets shakin_ in bed
Visions of her naked in my head
But I went off and chose myself instead
Why why why
Ease my mind
I don't know why, I
I don__ know, I dont know why
Why why why
I stepped off the stage with nothing left
All the lights were fuckin_ with my head
But here I am, singing songs again
Why why why
Ease my mind
I don__ know why, I
I don__ know, I don__ know why
Why why why
Why why why
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it
Thought I was about to be a father
Shook me to the core, I__ still a kid
Sometimes I still cry out for my mother
Why why why
Why why why
I don__ know why, I
I don__ know, I don__ know why
Why why why
Why why why
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes

LYRICS:
When your touch walks me home
When you taste this good
When the glitters is gold
And it feels like it should
When you__e so in love
And your souls touch
But it__ still not enough
Where does it go? (woah)
Where does it go?
Nobody knows (nobody, nobody)
Where the love goes
You__e an amateur drunk and everyone knows it
But fuck you__e the one and I live for those moments (ooo-woah)
When the bottle is open anything can happen
Flying too close to the sun 
When you__e so in love (oh you__e so in love)
And your souls touch (ohhh)
But it__ still not enough
Where does it go? (woah, hey)
Where does it go?
Nobody knows (hey! nobody)
Where the love goes

LYRICS

Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Honestly
It__ been a while since I__e thought of you
In the end we didn__ talk much
I didn__ know what you were going through
I__ sorry that I wasn__ there, to hug your mama at the funeral
Brian said he broke down, but he promised it was beautiful
When we were young
We didn__ care
We shot for the stars
I see you up there
You had a heart of gold (yea!)
You had a heart of gold
You left too soon
It was out of your control, underneath your skin and bones
You had a heart of gold
I didn__ cry, I didn__ even feel the pain
And then it hit me all at once
When we talked about you yesterday
When we were young (when we were young)
We didn__ care (we didn__ care)
We shot for the stars (shot for the stars)
I see you up there
You had a heart of gold (yea!)
You had a heart of gold
You left too soon
It was out of your control, underneath your skin and bones
You had a heart of gold
When we were young
We didn__ care
We shot for the stars
I see you up there
You had a heart of gold
When we were young (ooo, ohh)
We didn__ care (we didn__ care)
We shot for the stars
I see you up there
You had a heart of gold

Lyrics:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can__ be sold 
We were right til we weren__
Built a home and watched it burn 
_
I didn__ wanna leave you 
I didn__ wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
_
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don__ understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
_
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
_
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said 
_
I didn__ wanna wanna leave you 
I didn__ wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
_
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don__ understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand

Lyrics:
I don__ wanna call
And talk too long
I know it was wrong
But never said I was sorry

Now I__e had time to think it over
We__e much older
And the bone__ too big to bury

Isn__ it a shame that it ended like that
Said goodbye forever but you never unpacked
We went to hell but we never came back

I__ sorry that you__e jaded
I could__e taken you places
You__e lonely now and I hate it
I__ sorry that you__e jaded

You__e not even willing
To look up at your part
You just jump in your car
And head down to the bar
__il you__e blurry

Don__ know when to stop
So you take it too far
I don__ know where you are
And I__ left in the dark
__il I__ worried and it hurts me

And it__ a fucking shame that it ended like that
You broke your own heart but you__ never say that
We went to hell but we never came back

I__ sorry that you__e jaded
I could__e taken you places
You__e lonely now and I hate it
I__ sorry that you__e jaded

I won__ lie, it won__ be easy
When somebody new__ on your body
I__l change my number but keep your t-shirt
I don__ mind it__ torn up and faded

I__ sorry that you__e jaded
I could__e taken you places
You__e lonely now and I hate it
I__ sorry that you__e jaded
I__ sorry that you__e jaded

Lyrics:

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell.
A love no onecould deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me""",2013-09-09T16:00:38Z,0.44944439556381816,1.1980415083467162,1.1345022674314145,5.5782808522465075,"['Who else just randomly remembered this song?', 'we weren__ ready to see this in 2013', 'i  still can remember how shocked the media was when this came out.', 'at first i was annoyed at how she displayed herself, then i realized that it&#39;s her choice and she doesn&#39;t have to live her life to please people or based on people&#39;s opinions', 'Remember when the whole world was so shocked when this was uploaded', 'When this was first released people think it&#39;s disgusting<br>Coming back at it again it&#39;s insanely deep', '2024!!!

LYRICS

You promised the world and I fell for it 
I put you first and you adored it
You set fires to my forest
And you let it burn 
Sang off key in my chorus 
Cause it wasn__ yours 
I saw the signs and I ignored it 
Rose colored glasses all distorted 
You set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn 
You got off on the hurtin_ 
When it wasn__ yours 
We__ always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me 
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
I gave my all and they all know it
You tore me down and now it__ showing 
In two months you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing 
We__ always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me 
This dancing was killing me softly 
I needed to hate you to love me 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
You promised the world and I fell for it 
I put you first and you adored it
You set fires to my forest
And you let it burn 
Sang off key in my chorus- 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to hate you to love me
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah

And now the chapter is closed and done 
And now it__ goodbye
It__ goodbye for us

Lyrics

Wait __il I turn my love on
Wait __il, wait __il
Wait __il I turn my love on
I__ no cheap thrill
I__ a rollercoaster ride, baby jump on
Come on, come on
Cause baby if you can__ tell _ you__e what I wanna love on, ohh 
 
This doesn__ have to be some sort of mathematical equation
Slip off your jeans, slide in the sheets, screaming __es_ in quotations
Clock in, baby get to work
Night shift but with all the perks
Time stamping when you fell in love
Time can__ mess with us
 
Oooh, if you think about falling, got you covered like garments
Oooh, I deserve an applause for, keeping you up late __il you can__ see straight, 
Just wait, woo!
 
Wait __il I turn my love on
Wait __il, wait __il
Wait __il I turn my love on
I__ no cheap thrill
I__ a roller coaster ride, baby jump on
Come on come on
Cause baby if you can__ tell, you__e what I wanna love on, ohh! 
Wait __il I turn my love on
Wait __il wait till
Wait __il I turn my love on
You__l get your thrill
Just promise you__l be patient with the outcome
Come on
Cause baby if you can__ tell, you__e what I wanna love on
 
Why we conversing over this steak tartare when we could be
Somewhere other than here making out in the back of a car
Or in the back of a bar
Or we could make a memoir, yeah
On the back wall of the last stall in the bathroom at the bazaar

Oooh, if you think about falling, got you covered like garments
Oooh, I deserve an applause for, keeping you up late __il you can__ see straight, 
Just wait, woo! 

Wait __il I turn my love on
Wait __il, wait __il
Wait __il I turn my love on
I__ no cheap thrill
I__ a roller coaster ride, baby jump on
Come on come on
Cause baby if you can__ tell, you__e what I wanna love on, ohh! 
Wait __il I turn my love on
Wait __il, wait __il
Wait __il I turn my love on
You__l get your thrill
Just promise you__l be patient with the outcome
Come on
Cause baby if you can__ tell, you__e what I wanna love on

Wait __il I
Wait __il I
 
Baby if you can__ tell, you__e what I wanna love on, ohh!

Lyrics:

Flipping through all of these magazines
Telling me who I__ supposed to be
Way too good at camouflage
Can__ see what I am,
I just see what I__ not
I__ guilty __out everything that I eat (every single thing)
Feeling myself is a felony
Jedi level sabotage
Voices in my head make up my entourage

Cause I__ a black belt when I__ beating up on myself
But I__ an expert at giving love to somebody else
I _ me and myself and
I _ don__ see eye to 
Eye _ me and myself and
I _ 

Oh, why do I compare myself to everyone
And I always got my finger on the self destruct
I wonder when I love me is enough (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wonder when I love me is enough (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Why am I always looking for a ride or die
Cause mine__ the only heart I__ gonna have for life
After all the times I went and fucked it up (all the times I went and fucked it up)
I wonder when I love me is enough (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I wonder when I love me is enough
I wonder when I love me is enough

Haters that live on the internet
Live in my head, should be paying rent
I__ way too good at listening
All these comments fucking up my energy

Cause I__ a black belt when I__ beating up on myself
But I__ an expert at giving love to somebody else
I _ me and myself and
I _ don__ see eye to 
Eye _ me and myself and
I _ 

Oh, why do I compare myself to everyone
And I always got my finger on the self destruct
I wonder when I love me is enough (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wonder when I love me is enough (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Why am I always looking for a ride or die
Cause mine__ the only heart I__ gonna have for life
After all the times I went and fucked it up (all the times I went and fucked it up)
I wonder when I love me is enough (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I wonder when I love me is enough
I wonder when I love me is enough

I__ my own worst critic
Talk a whole lot of shit
But I__ a ten out of ten
Even when I forget
I-I-I-I (I__ a ten out of ten, don't you ever forget it)

I__ my own worst critic
Talk a whole lot of shit
But I__ a ten out of ten
Even when I forget

Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry

It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

Oh-ooh, whoa-oh (Come on, come on, uh)

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', ""Let's go"")
Oh (But my heart is sayin', ""No, no"")

Baby, there's a price to pay

I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's bangin' and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight (Yeah)
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', ""Let's go"")
Oh, ooh (Mm, but my heart is sayin' no, but my heart is sayin', ""No, no"")

I can make your wish come true (Your wish come true, oh)
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

Come on over, come on over, baby
I want you to know you could be the one for me
Yes, you could (yes, you could)
You've got all I'm looking for
You've got personality

Oh baby baby

Give me a sign

Heartbreaker
You got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Lyrics:

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Lyrics:

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

Lyrics:

What if I told you
It was all meant to be
Would you believe me,
Would you agree
It's almost that feelin'
That we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come and now...

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime,
For a moment like this
Some people search forever,
For that one special kiss

Lyrics:

Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure you've found it
Slow motion sparks
You caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh yes they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh no I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand
And your heart on your sleeve
Oh no I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight

Lyrics:

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling

Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your hard to miss think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Lyrics:

If you had my love 
And I gave you all my trust 
Would you comfort me 
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me 
And call me baby 
Now if I gave you me, this is how it's got to be 
First of all I won't take you cheatin' on me 
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you 
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool 
You said that we could possibly spend eternity 
See that's what you told me (that's what you said) 
But if you want me 
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams 
(If you really want me babe) 

Said you want my love and you've got to have it all 
But first there are some things you need to know 
If you want to live 
With all I have to give 
I need to feel true love 
Or it's got to end, yeah 
I don't want you 
Trying to get with me 
And I end up unhappy 
(Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain) 
So before I do 
Give myself to you 
I have to know the truth 
(If I spend my life with you)

Electro music taken to new dimensions with this uplifting piece of work. Dry beats get blended with some strong melodic progressions, while vocal samples fill in the blanks -it simply works like a charm! Tiger is exactly where electro music is today, fresh and innnovative while keeping the original energy. BIG!

Lyrics:
I am walking down that road
Where did all the flowers go?
They say we're supposed to grow
Learning from the highs and low
All eyes lying on me, oh
Begging me to play the role
'Cause I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I'm gonna get it right
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
All my dreams are running wild
I'm gonna chase them down
They said, ""you can't lose your mind, hurry up, you're out of time""
I said, ""I will rise and shine, even in the coldest night""
'Cause I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right
You can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I'm gonna get it right
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right

Lyrics: 
Heartless heartless heartless
So heartless so heartless so heartless
Say you__e going out late 
I count down till you call me 
It__ just one of those things 
That you do when you__e lonely 
And you__e all about the chase 
But you won__ ever let me catch you 
And I wish I was the same 
But I know I__ gunna let you in again and when I do 
Its gunna hurt like hell and you don__ mean to 
That__ what I tell myself 
 
But, why you gotta be so heartless 
I know you think it__ harmless
You__e tearing me apart 
And girl the hardest part is 
You__e so high on attention 
Taking miles from inches 
Leave me in the darkness 
Never finish what we started 
Girl why you gotta be so heartless (so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless (so heartless) 
 
Monday night was definitely not our night 
Tuesday night was just another fight 
Wednesday I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night we went out on the town 
Saturday we should have burned it down 
Sunday morning came and now you__e gone 
I should probably know this shit by now
Ah ohh 
I should probably know this shit by now 
But no, no
 
Why you gotta be so heartless 
I know you think it__ harmless
You__e tearing me apart 
And girl the hardest part is 
You__e so high on attention 
Taking miles from inches 
Leave me in the darkness 
Never finish what we started 
Girl why you gotta be so heartless (so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless (so heartless) 
 
Girl why you gotta be so in between 
Loving me and leaving, leaving 
Ah ohh
I should probably know this shit by now 
But no, no

Why you gotta be so heartless 
I know you think it__ harmless
You__e tearing me apart 
And girl the hardest part is 
You__e so high on attention 
Taking miles from inches 
Leave me in the darkness 
Never finish what we started 
Girl why you gotta be so heartless (so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless (so heartless)

Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs

Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware

Of just how we got,
into this mess
Got so aggressive

I know we meant
All good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen

Floors are wet
Taps are still running
Dishes are broken

How did we get,
into this mess
Got so aggressive

I know we meant
All good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection

And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just...

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me babe
Are you happy now
You're the only one, who can up and run, leave me just as empty as the day you came
You hold all the cards, all the broken hearts, strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain
And only you know the strength of your teeth
Wash in the weight of your pockets so deep
And lonely
You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me babe
Are you happy now
Are you happy now
In the palm of your hands, you can make me dance, spin me round in circles till I'm wrapped in string
You keep on talking sweet, till your fingers bleed, but don't you dare ask me how I've been
Now only you know the strength of your teeth
Wash in the weight of your pockets so deep
And lonely
You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me babe
Are you happy now
Are you happy now

LYRICS
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you and you've got to

Make it on your own but, we don't have to grow up, we can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola, underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

Won__ admit what I already know
I__e never been the best at letting go
I don__ wanna spend the night alone
Yes I need you
And I need to

Make it on my own but, I don't wanna grow up, we can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola, underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going and you know that

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

All you have to do is stay
All you have to do is stay
So stay
Yeah

All you have to do is stay
A minute
Just take
Your time
The clock
Is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait
A second
Your hands, on mine
The clock is ticking
So stay

Avicii,electronic,IcrbM1l_BoI,Avicii - Wake Me Up (Official Video),"__t__ so far away from anything I__e ever done before musically, so it__ obviously a weight off my shoulders that everything went the way it did_ _ Tim __vicii_ Bergling.
 
June 17th 2023 marks one decade since the release of Wake Me Up _ a song that came to change EDM music forever. As a key part of the album True, Wake Me Up was one of the songs where Avicii showed the world his ability to blend different genres _ transcending the boundaries of ages, music preferences, and cultures worldwide.

In loving memory of Tim Bergling (1989-2018).

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 2]
Hey, brother
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love?
I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love?
I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call

Tonight I'm gonna put it on the table
Gonna leave it all out for you (For you)
Tonight I'm gonna show you that I'm able (Able)
Remind you what you've got to lose

Standing in your window, middle of December
Times change, but I'll always remember
I don't know where I'd be without you (Ah)
One more summer, one more winter
I wanna spend life with ya
I don't know where I'd be without you

A lot of people ask me where Alone and its lyrics comes from. Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn__ belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn__ really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you__e homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren__ like everyone else_its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family_a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone. I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do. It gives me the feels for sure.

When @bastilledan sent me happier for the first time I was taken back. The amount of emotion that you could feel in the lyrics was crazy. As I listened to the song more and more it reminded me of so many things I__e been through in my life. Toxic relationships, letting go of things I didn__ want to and just situations where happiness came with a sacrifice. Recently I lost my best friend, my companion, my life long friend. I wanted this video to embrace the pain that we feel losing or sacrificing something and the cycle of life that comes with it. I hope this song and video can bring closure in any situation you may be and make us all happier __

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

""India is special and its beauty absolutely humbled me. When we toured there as Major Lazer, it was mind blowing to see our fan-base and we wanted to incorporate the attitude and positive vibes into our video and just do something that embodies the essence of Major Lazer. Major Lazer has always been a culture mashup and to us, India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future. The experience is something we'll never forget.""

_ LYRICS _

Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standin' strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on (hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on
(We need someone to lean on, hey)
(Hey, hey)
A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on
(Major Lazer, hey)
Oh, oh-oh
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
We need someone to lean on (hey, hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
All we need is somebody to lean on (hey, hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
We need someone to lean on (hey, hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on (hey, hey)

_ LYRICS _

Yeah
They thought that you was a shy girl
Until I made you my girl
Girl you pushed me like a big button
Til I cuffed you like you did something

You aint got to wait for it
You aint got to wait for me to give you my love
You aint got to wait for it
Things are getting sticky
Girl I think that I'm stuck

I'll admit I'm wrong when 
I know that you gon' come for me
Never gonna not not hit that
Your lovin is drugs to me

And everytime you hit my phone
When you say you need company 

Ohh imma run up on you
Imma run up on you
8x imma run up on you

Girl you're used to being quiet
Until I brought that loud
You say your dollars is a mountain
And your momma your accountant 

You watch your figure
Cause you're a big deal
Got your fresh prince 
And a big whip 

Polo mink coat that's a big kill
Put you on a phone
Like a windshield 

I'll admit I'm wrong when 
I know that you gon' come for me
Never gonna not not hit that
Your lovin is drugs to me
And everytime you hit my phone
When you say you need company 

Ohh imma run up on you
Imma run up on you
Imma run up on you

Major keys im the boss
Dont griselda go off 
Left from the loft and 
Went to bergdorf
Most of these dudes is really quite soft
45 special this is my cloth
Bout to drop a album this is my fourth 
I don't put sugar in my spaghetti sauce
Drop a freestyle and get these hoes parched

Fire burn the obea man church 
Pretty girls, where my girls get right
Cause it's another day, let ya light shine bright
Aint none of them in your lane
True mi have di game pon lock, dem wah code 
Just link wit some hot gyal out ah road 
True mi have di waist small, pretty, bus whine
Rolex nah deh pon uno dutty gyal time?
Yo, I told em pull up on me faster than danica
Thats on the low I'm tryna blow him like harmonicas 
He call me queen he know nicki is the moniker. 
He want a mix between hillary and monica 
I switch it up I switch it up rip the beat then I I stitch it up. 
Travel then I bounce I ball sinead sir
Barbie a link up major lazer. 

Ohh imma run up on you
Imma run up on you
Imma run up on you

LYRICS: 

I didn't know that I was broken until I found my missing piece.
It seemed like every door was closing on me.
You were so far out of reach.

Drunk on the night.
You got lips like your wine.
I got nothing but time for you.
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes.
I got nothing but time for you.

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That loneliness is my disease.
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That you are the remedy.
You are the remedy.
You are the remedy. 

I didn't have no one to turn to.
I was circling the drain.
But now you showed me I can learn too.
How to be okay again.

Drunk on the night.
You got lips like your wine.
I got nothing but time for you.
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes.
I got nothing but time for you.

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That loneliness is my disease.
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That you are the remedy. 
You are the remedy.
You are the remedy.

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That loneliness is my disease.
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe,
That you are the remedy.
You are the remedy.
You are the remedy.

Words Lyrics:
I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

at your house again
are we more than friends 
there__ so much that I wanna say
but I gotta hold it back
so scared how you__l react 
I just hide it all away 

i could give you it all 
in a minute could fall
any minute but we go round and round 
i don__ wanna mention commitment but I 
feel it slippin so please 
don__ let me down
me down 

I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

oh I feel like 
as soon as they leave my mouth
you__e just gonna get up and run
you__e gonna run away

you know we connect
more than just the sex 
but are you gonna let me in

I could set your world on fire 
but you__e holding the lighter
instead you__e putting out our flame

I could give you it all 
in a minute could fall
any minute but we go round and round 
I don__ wanna mention commitment but I 
feel it slippin so please 
don__ let me down


I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

oh I feel like 
as soon as they leave my mouth
you__e just gonna get up and run
you__e gonna run away

run away 
run away  

I got the words 
I love you
Sitting on the tip of my tongue 

oh I feel like 
as soon as they leave my mouth
you__e just gonna get up and run
you__e gonna run away

if I say it now
then one day i__l wake up and you__e walked out 

so i__l just stay here with 
the words I love you
sitting on the tip of my tongue

Current world #1 DJ Hardwell has had an extraordinary 2014. From continuing to rule supreme over the dance music world, reeling off top-charting hit after hit with epic releases such as __are You_, __verybody Is In The Place_, the iconic Dutch producer now delivers the newest single __oung Again_, from his forthcoming debut album, which is also equipped to hit a high note amongst the charts. Always one to nurture the brightest talents in the industry, Hardwell has enlisted British vocalist Chris Jones, to add a raw, rock-orientated tone, to his euphoric, soaring melodies.
Powered with emotion, __oung Again_ is a merger of genre-bending bliss, fusing rootsy, electro-acoustic guitar strings with Jones__ powerful vocals that command attention the second the track begins, a new anthem is truly unleashed. Questioning __ill We Ever Feel Young Again?_, as the track switches between towering club beats and dominant drops, key chords pound beneath the catchy melody, accumulating in a vocal-driven club stormer with mass appeal. 
Highlighting Hardwell__ sheer versatility by stepping out of the traditional, progressive-house blueprint and daring to be different, by not being pinned down to a specific strain of dance music and finding inspiration all around him, __oung Again_ is an infectious record readied to dominate the charts and one that is setting up the imminent release of his new artist album very nicely!

Following the worldwide release of his debut artist album United We Are and two sold-out launch shows at Amsterdam__ Ziggo Dome for his new world tour concept; I AM HARDWELL _ United We Are, the two time World #1 DJ, Hardwell, completed a landmark weekend and set the precedent for his year ahead. 

The second night of the Amsterdam launch party weekend saw Hardwell broadcast live and direct from the Ziggo Dome show across 30 national FM stations worldwide, with total figures exceeding 5 million listeners. Whilst the video livestream saw in excess of 14.000 viewers tuned in from America to Australia to watch the show, reaffirming Hardwell__ presence has __he most clicked on_ artists in the electronic scene today.

Already topping the iTunes singles chart at #1 in Hardwell__ native home of The Netherlands, __nited We Are_ also swept in at #2 on iTunes__ worldwide album chart during its release weekend, showcasing a defining collection of tracks. Including an additional line-up of collaborators that cites TiâÂ´sto, Fatman Scoop, W&W, Andreas Moe, Bright Lights, Jonathan Mendelsohn, Haris, Funkerman feat I-Fan and DallsasK, Headhunterz and Jason Derulo, __nited We Are_ is an album primed with club-ready hits that will no doubt become the soundtrack to the summer festival season. Following the album__ release Hardwell has now released the official music video for his latest single  __ally_.

Out since January 16th, __ally_ stands out because of the presence of guitar riffs and the pop-punk influences, both clearly noticeable on Hardwells first release of 2015. Fusing a rock____oll approach with Harrison__ edgy vocal delivery and Hardwell__ drop-inducing talent, the __ally_ video brings a provocative look at the green-eyed femme fatale in question, complete with rib-snapping riff action and a hip-shooting amount of attitude.  

Other special guests, alongside Harrison, who joined Hardwell onstage during the first I Am Harwell _ United We Are shows of 2015, included Mr. Probz and Chris Jones.

When the lights go out and day gives way to night, the space takes on a mysterious and unsettling character. It is in the dark that the deepest human fears hide, but also the most precious secrets.<br><br>Melancholy fills the air like the heavy scent of old books and forgotten memories. The darkness is like a mirror for the soul, reflecting all our worries, unfulfilled dreams, and lost hopes. In its depths lies something more than just the absence of light; it is an ocean of the unknown, full of shadows of the past and whispering voices that remind us of what has passed and will never return.<br><br>Sometimes it seems that in the darkness, one can hear the beating of one&#39;s own heart, as if in this endless silence life becomes more vivid. Every step, every whisper seems like an infinite echo, carrying with it a story of loneliness and longing. In the dark, somewhere between reality and dream, melancholy becomes an inseparable companion, reminding us that everything we love and care about is fleeting.<br><br>Darkness is also a place where thoughts can wander endlessly, and the soul seeks solace. It is precisely in these moments, when the darkness is deepest, that a person finds the true essence of their solitude, and at the same time, the most beautiful aspects of their sensitivity. The darkness, with all its majesty and mystery, becomes a kind of refuge for those who feel more and dream more intensely.<br><br>And although the darkness seems impenetrable, it always hides a seed of light. It is in its heart that hope is born, that every end is the beginning of something new, and the deepest night always gives way to dawn. In this constant play of light and shadow, melancholy reminds us of the fragile nature of our existence and the beauty that lies in impermanence.', 'THIS is the music the world has been missing so much.

Subscribe to Armada TV: http://bit.ly/SubscribeArmada

It's the first official single of the album that dance land has been waiting for. The premier introduction to 'Intense', the fifth artist album of the world's number one DJ, Armin van Buuren. It's the feel-good 'This Is What It Feels Like' ft. Trevor Guthrie, that rushes in.

Its official music video was shot in the great Nevada desert, in between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, by Pixelheaven.tv. It features Armin van Buuren and Trevor Guthrie, racing cars for 'the hot girl' on the sandy roads. But there's also a surprising guest starring in the music video: American adult-film legend Ron Jeremy, playing the supporting role as owner of the road diner where Armin and Trevor continue their battle.

Gathering two years of extraordinary production work and song-writing, 'Intense' is the next addition to Armin's legacy. 'Intense' landing May 3rd, the first single is an exclusive pre-taste of its genre-bending sound.

Featuring Canadian singer/songwriter Trevor Guthrie, Armin brings a musical fusion that has its roots in dance, rock and pop. Coming together in the easy-listening, up-tempo tune that is 'This Is What It Feels Like', Armin once again proves not to be a prisoner of his own style.

2013 brings a new musical promise to the fans of Armin van Buuren. The first one to come alive, is the soulful 'Waiting For The Night', featuring the crispy clear vocals of the talented Fiora Cutler. A warm, sparkling tune, giving sound to Armin's latest score, for Dutch movie 'Verliefd op Ibiza'. 

Armin van Buuren wouldn't be where he is today if he wasn't driven by new challenges. In 2013, many new ones await him. But he faces them all, kicking off 2013 with the official theme song to the 'Verliefd op Ibiza' ('In Love With Ibiza') movie. And quite the anthem it is. 'Waiting For The Night' has that warm, dreamy melody, powerful hook and catchy vibe, a perfect base to the mesmerizing voice of Fiora. Take a trip to Ibiza and have your perfect night out, in mere minutes.

The first light of dawn remains unseen, as two remixes of 'Waiting For The Night' await you. LA's most wanted, Clinton VanSciver, bathes the tune in a unique blend of electro-house, disco and prog. Ingenious and original. Estonian producer Beat Service was given the honour to be the official A State Of Trance premiere of 'WFTN', as it impressed the listeners with its deep progressive rush.

Without ever making the music lose its distinctive trance character, Armin van Buuren released an album bursting with diversity. 'Mirage' has set forth a sound that doesn't let itself be caught in a one-style corner. Singles 'Full Focus', 'Not Giving Up On Love', 'This Light Between Us' and 'Drowning' all caused different impact, but exploding the global dancefloors they did.

The fifth single taken from 'Mirage', is another new story to be told. For the single 'Feels So Good', that Armin co-wrote with the famous sing/songwriter duo of Mim and Liv Nervo, he invited the vocal queen of EDM, Nadia Ali. Her seductive voice still warms the crowds, years after her IIO classic 'Rapture' first shattered across the arena's and clubs. For Armin's 'Shivers' album in 2005, she rocked the powerful 'Who Is Watching?', now followed by a more playful 'Feels So Good' 6 years later. Rapturous as always, Nadia's voice seductively flirts with a heavy but teasing bassguitar, laidback beat and electric melody. Sweeping you off your feet from first play on, you'll be hooked to 'Feels So Good' in no time.

To make 'Feels So Good' suit the peak-time moments on the floor, Armin didn't only bring a warm but techy-edged club mix of the original himself, but also invited Jerome Isma-Ae, Jochen Miller and Tristan Garner to the party. Jerome Isma-Ae did what he does best: deliver a remix with a bouncy progressive-house touch, layered with soothing melodies. Jochen Miller, mostly known for his tougher takes at remix duties, reveals his softer side. Jochen focuses on the instrumental part, adding a melodramatic touch without making 'Feels So Good' lose its feel-good sound. 
Last but not least, French producer Tristan Garner delivers a sexy and exotic remix, build around heavy drums and melody, rhythmic in every way.

Sarah Vaughan,jazz,lJXLqAutql4,Sarah Vaughan - Misty (Live from Sweden) Mercury Records 1964,"""Misty"" is a jazz standard written in 1954 by the pianist Erroll Garner.  Originally composed as an instrumental following the traditional 32-bar format, the tune later had lyrics by Johnny Burke and became the signature song of Johnny Mathis.

Sarah Lois Vaughan (March 27, 1924 -- April 3, 1990) was an American jazz singer, described by Scott Yanow as having ""one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century."" Nicknamed ""Sailor"" (for her salty speech), ""Sassy"" and ""The Divine One"", Sarah Vaughan was a Grammy Award winner. The National Endowment for the Arts bestowed upon her its ""highest honor in jazz"", the NEA Jazz Masters Award, in 1989.

Vaughan was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Asbury ""Jake"" Vaughan, a carpenter by trade who played guitar and piano, and Ada Vaughan, a laundress who sang in the church choir, migrants from Virginia. The Vaughans lived in a house on Brunswick Street in Newark for Vaughan's entire childhood. Jake was deeply religious. The family was active in New Mount Zion Baptist Church at 186 Thomas Street. Vaughan began piano lessons at the age of seven, sang in the church choir, and played piano for rehearsals and services. Sarah and her family were all registered Democrats.

She developed an early love for popular music. In the 1930s, she frequently saw local and touring bands at the Montgomery Street Skating Rink. By her mid-teens, she ventured illegally into Newark's night clubs and performed as a pianist and singer at the Piccadilly Club and at Newark Airport.

Vaughan attended East Side High School, then transferred to Newark Arts High School, which opened in 1931. As her nocturnal adventures as a performer overtook her academic pursuits, she dropped out of high school during her junior year to concentrate more fully on her music.

In 1989, Vaughan's health began to decline, although she rarely revealed any hints of this in her performances. She canceled a series of engagements in Europe in 1989, citing the need to seek treatment for arthritis of the hand, although she was able to complete a series of performances in Japan. During a run at New York's Blue Note Jazz Club in 1989, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and was too ill to finish the last day of what would turn out to be her final series of public performances.

Vaughan returned to her home in California to begin chemotherapy and spent her final months alternating stays in the hospital and at home. She grew weary of the struggle and demanded to be taken home, where at the age of 66 she died on the evening of April 3, 1990, while watching Laker Girls, a television movie featuring her daughter.

Her funeral was held at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. Following the ceremony, a horse-drawn carriage transported her body to Glendale Cemetery, Bloomfield.

Parallels have been drawn between Vaughan's voice and those of opera singers. Jazz singer Betty Carter said that with training Vaughan could have ""gone as far as Leontyne Price."" Bob James, Vaughan's musical director in the 1960s said that ""the instrument was there. But the knowledge, the legitimacy of that whole world were not for her ... But if the aria were in Sarah's range she could bring something to it that a classically trained singer could not.""

In a chapter devoted to Vaughan in his book Visions of Jazz (2000), critic Gary Giddins described her as the ""ageless voice of modern jazz _ of giddy postwar virtuosity, biting wit and fearless caprice"". He concluded by saying that ""No matter how closely we dissect the particulars of her talent ... we must inevitably end up contemplating in silent awe the most phenomenal of her attributes, the one she was handed at birth, the voice that happens once in a lifetime, perhaps once in several lifetimes.""

Sarah's accompanied by Kirk Stuart (piano), Charles ""Buster"" Williams (bass), and Georges Hughes (drums).  Recorded in Sweden, 1964.  (Mercury Records)

Look at me,
 I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
Feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
 I can't understand,
 I get misty just holding your hand.
 
Walk my way,
 And a thousand violins begin to play
 Might be the sound of your hello
 That music I hear,
 I get misty the moment you're near
 
And you can see that you're leading me on
 And it's just, and  it's just what I want you to do
 Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
 That's why I'm following you.
 
On my own,
 Would I wander through this wonderland alone
 Never knowing my right foot from my left,
 My hat from my glove,
 I'm too misty, and too much in love.


And you can see that you're leading me on
 And it's just, and  it's just what I want you to do
 Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
 That's why I'm following you.
 
On my own,
 Would I wander through this wonderland alone
 Never knowing my right foot from my left,

Sarah Vaughan,jazz,uR1GYQzf8zY,Sarah Vaughan - Somewhere Over The Rainbow (Live from Holland 1958),"""Over the Rainbow"" (often referred to as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"") is a ballad, with music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by E.Y. Harburg. It was written for the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, and was sung by actress Judy Garland in her starring role as Dorothy Gale. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became Garland's signature song, as well as one of the most enduring standards of the 20th century.

Sarah Lois Vaughan (March 27, 1924 -- April 3, 1990) was an American jazz singer, described by Scott Yanow as having ""one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century."" Nicknamed ""Sailor"" (for her salty speech), ""Sassy"" and ""The Divine One"", Sarah Vaughan was a Grammy Award winner. The National Endowment for the Arts bestowed upon her its ""highest honor in jazz"", the NEA Jazz Masters Award, in 1989.

Vaughan was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Asbury ""Jake"" Vaughan, a carpenter by trade who played guitar and piano, and Ada Vaughan, a laundress who sang in the church choir, migrants from Virginia. The Vaughans lived in a house on Brunswick Street in Newark for Vaughan's entire childhood. Jake was deeply religious. The family was active in New Mount Zion Baptist Church at 186 Thomas Street. Vaughan began piano lessons at the age of seven, sang in the church choir, and played piano for rehearsals and services. Sarah and her family were all registered Democrats.

She developed an early love for popular music. In the 1930s, she frequently saw local and touring bands at the Montgomery Street Skating Rink. By her mid-teens, she ventured illegally into Newark's night clubs and performed as a pianist and singer at the Piccadilly Club and at Newark Airport.

Vaughan attended East Side High School, then transferred to Newark Arts High School, which opened in 1931. As her nocturnal adventures as a performer overtook her academic pursuits, she dropped out of high school during her junior year to concentrate more fully on her music.

In 1989, Vaughan's health began to decline, although she rarely revealed any hints of this in her performances. She canceled a series of engagements in Europe in 1989, citing the need to seek treatment for arthritis of the hand, although she was able to complete a series of performances in Japan. During a run at New York's Blue Note Jazz Club in 1989, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and was too ill to finish the last day of what would turn out to be her final series of public performances.

Vaughan returned to her home in California to begin chemotherapy and spent her final months alternating stays in the hospital and at home. She grew weary of the struggle and demanded to be taken home, where at the age of 66 she died on the evening of April 3, 1990, while watching Laker Girls, a television movie featuring her daughter.

Her funeral was held at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. Following the ceremony, a horse-drawn carriage transported her body to Glendale Cemetery, Bloomfield.

Parallels have been drawn between Vaughan's voice and those of opera singers. Jazz singer Betty Carter said that with training Vaughan could have ""gone as far as Leontyne Price."" Bob James, Vaughan's musical director in the 1960s said that ""the instrument was there. But the knowledge, the legitimacy of that whole world were not for her ... But if the aria were in Sarah's range she could bring something to it that a classically trained singer could not.""

In a chapter devoted to Vaughan in his book Visions of Jazz (2000), critic Gary Giddins described her as the ""ageless voice of modern jazz _ of giddy postwar virtuosity, biting wit and fearless caprice"". He concluded by saying that ""No matter how closely we dissect the particulars of her talent ... we must inevitably end up contemplating in silent awe the most phenomenal of her attributes, the one she was handed at birth, the voice that happens once in a lifetime, perhaps once in several lifetimes.""

Sarah's accompanied by Richard Davis (Bass); Ronnell Bright (Piano); and Art Morgan (Drums).

Somewhere over the rainbow
 Way up high
 There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby

 Somewhere over the rainbow
 Skies are blue
 And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

 Someday I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops
 Away above the chimney tops
 That's where you'll find me

 Somewhere over the rainbow
 Blue birds fly
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Why then, oh, why can't I?

 If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Now you say you're lonely
You cry the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

[Verse 2]
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

[Bridge]
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

[Verse 3]
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

[Outro]
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

In July 2023 MetLiveArts welcomed three-time GRAMMYÂ¬Ã-winning jazz vocalist CâÂ©cile McLorin Salvant for a digital-exclusive in the Unicorn Tapestries Room at The Met Cloisters. For Salvant, also a skilled textile artist, the tapestries have been a source of inspiration. Much of her music relates vivid stories of mythical creatures__er acclaimed __gresse,_ which tells of a fantastical, forest-dwelling monster-woman, premiered at The Met in 2018. Now, alongside several of her closest collaborators, Salvant creates a program that reimagines songs from her latest album, __âÂ©lusine,_ drawing on the beloved Unicorn Tapestries_ mythological grandeur and themes of corporeal and ethereal love.

The European folkloric legend of MâÂ©lusine__ woman who becomes half-serpent each Saturday due to a childhood curse__orms the basis for Salvant__ album. MâÂ©lusine weds the young Raymondin on the condition that they never see each other on Saturdays, but at the urging of his brother, Raymondin betrays this promise. In this original song, Salvant, accompanied by a lone theorbo (a French baroque lute), tells of the sorrowful moment when the eponymous maiden sees her husband spying as she bathes nude.

Sting and Wayne Shorter received the Polar Music Prize on June 15, 2017 at a ceremony at Konserthuset Stockholm, Sweden. Several artists honored the Laureates together with the The Royal Stockholm Philarmonic Orchestra, led by maestro Hans Ek.

Artists performing in tribute to Sting and Wayne Shorter, included Gregory Porter, Jennie Abrahamson, Lennart _berg, Marius Neset, JosâÂ© Feliciano (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gZWIE081po), Jelena Krstic, Josefin Runsteen, Ane Brun (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E11Dw5t0iTw), Linnea Olsson, Fredrik Ljungqvist and The Tallest Man On Earth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR1R2XvNQJc).

JosâÂ© Feliciano also read the citation for Sting (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xJHRHdrYs):
""The 2017 Polar Music Prize is awarded to the singer, musician and composer Sting, real name Gordon Sumner, from Wallsend in Northumberland. Sting grew up in a shipyard town in northeastern England. As a child his thoughts and dreams roamed as far as the ships that sailed from his town. Internal and external travel has also characterised his music. As a member of the trio The Police, and later as a solo artist, Sting has never sat back and rested on his laurels; he has put down his anchor in more musical harbours than perhaps any other artist of his generation. As a composer, Sting has combined classic pop with virtuoso musicianship and an openness to all genres and sounds from around the world. Sting is a true citizen of the world, who has also been indefatigable in using his position as an arena-filling artist to promote human rights.""

The Polar Music Prize was founded in 1989 by the late Stig __tikkan_ Anderson, one of the true greats in the history of popular music. As the publisher, lyricist and manager of ABBA, he played a key role in their enormous success. Its name stems from Anderson__ legendary record label, Polar Music.

The Polar Music Prize is one of the most prestigious and unique music prizes in the world, crossing over musical boundaries and awarded to individuals, groups and institutions in recognition of exceptional achievements.

Lyrics:
Hey Laura it's me
Sorry but I had to rang your doorbell so late
But there's something bothering me
I really am sorry but it just couldn't wait
Is there someone else instead of me
Go ahead and lie to me and make me believe
You're not in love with him and this fool will see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me
Hey Laura it's me
Sorry but I had to ring your doorbell so late
Well there's something bothering me all night long
It just couldn't wait
With a healthy dose of make-believe
Go ahead and lie to me and make me believe
That you're in love with me, this fool will see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me
Hey Laura
Hey Laura it's me
Sorry but I had to ring your doorbell so late
Well there's something bothering me
All night long it just couldn't wait
With a healthy dose of make-believe
Go ahead and lie to me and make me believe
That you're in love with me this foul can see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me
Hey Laura it's me
Hey Laura it's me
Hey Laura it's me

""Be Good"" is the first video from Jazz singer Gregory Porter's critically acclaimed album of the same name.

Video Credits: Directed by award-winning filmmaker Pierre Bennu, with cinematography by Shawn Peters and special set work by visual artist Dirk Joseph.

Shot entirely on location in Baltimore, Maryland, director Pierre Bennu visually compliments Porter's intense lyrics and smooth, soulful vocals with vibrant colors and whimsical storytelling, and sets it all against Charm City's unique backdrop. As two lovers traverse their everyday lives amidst the mundane, Bennu draws on the power of everyday magic, the fear of loss, and the yearning for love in what he calls a ""lullaby for your inner child."" 

""The dance of love is something that can be done alone but it is also fun with somebody else,"" says Bennu. ""I wanted to show two characters; one who was so busy dancing alone, never looking to have a partner... and another so desperate for love that he would do whatever it took to get it. What that character finally realizes is that all he needed to offer forth was himself.""

To compliment his artistic vision, Bennu tapped the talents of Baltimore-based multidisciplinary visual artist Dirk Joseph, whose 'magical props' add significantly to the video's playful and enchanting sensibility.",2012-03-20T20:31:42Z,0.718920649678423,-0.5120591115035402,-0.5827901125175392,-0.533010836761606,"['This was my wife favorite song , when I first played this she asked me to dance with her not knowing this would be the last song I would dance with her.

""Melody Gardot__ tribute to the legacy of Emmett Till via the video,  Preacher Man and song, helps  to take each of us on an important emotional journey back in history. Preacher Man, sadly also raises our consciousness, as we witness the haunting tragedy of 14 year old Emmett Till__ death on August 28, 1955. At the same time, Melody's lyrics remind us of the many sons and daughters who, in more recent years have met a similar fate as Emmett.  All have gone tragically and much too soon, but should never be forgotten.  The Emmett Till Legacy Foundation is especially honored as we enter a special time of remembrance, commemorating the 60 year anniversary of Emmett Till__ death and the courage of Emmett Till__ mother, Mamie Till Mobley. Emmett Till's kidnapping, murder, open casket funeral along with the acquittal and later confession of the murderers shook the core of America and the world and is recognized as the impetus for the powerful civil rights movement."" Emmett Till Legacy Foundation

100% of all income received by Decca from Vevo views of the __reacherman_ video will be paid through to the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation for the first year following initial UK release.

Lyrics
sink into the ground wide and steady while the burning 
flickers to a glow out the temple of your ear 
while the levy of our predicament__ unyielding - 
love come flood through here 

in and round the walls of your heavy-minded palace 
suddenly the air goes miraculously clear 
un-cupping your brim of the never-ending chalice 
in rushes love__ atmosphere 

body, you__e the bell sounding through the heavy pulling 
ringing out a calm from the belly of your sway 
all there is to do now is really re-remember 
that love is and tune its way 

body is your bell sounding through the heavy pulling 
ringing out a calm from the belly of your sway 
all there is to do now is really re-remember 
that love is and tune its way

Lyrics:

Sunrise, sunrise

Looks like mornin' in your eyes

But the clock's held 9:15 for hours

Sunrise, sunrise

Couldn't tempt us if it tried

'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

Surprise, surprise

Couldn't find it in your eyes

But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise, surprise

Never something I could hide

When I see we made it through another day

And I said

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

Now the night

Will throw its cover down

On me again

Ooh, and if I'm right

It's the only way

To bring me back

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

Hoo, ooh, yeah

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

To you

And sure, I suppose nowadays there are maybe 2 or 3 other singers in the world who have &quot;as beautiful&quot; a voice as Norah, purely from a sonically pleasant POV. But, to my mind, none of them have the kind of emotive story-telling and innocent nature, that oases out from Norah&#39;s incredible vocal. It&#39;s not &quot;just&quot; that she&#39;s a great singer, it&#39;s that she always sings with 100% of her heart, and is absolutely dedicated to expressing the theme of any song that she sings. She is almost unerring in knowing the right KIND of vocal that a song needs as well.

The writing on this song is Bob Dylan caliber writing. <br>I have had this on a loop and am trying to learn it on guitar. <br><br>In spite of the video I think this is a breakup song. She is lamenting what she cannot have -true love. Someone lost her love...Her true love, &quot;what you lost I&#39;ve never found&quot;.  She quietly and peacefully walks away from the man who cannot love her. In some way she is pulling him away from his destiny and assures him that if he needs to talk he is safe to do so. She is still his friend and cares for him. She will not try and draw him back into something that was not meant to be. She still cares but has accepted that she cannot love this man without somehow ruining him and he cannot ever possibly truly love her as she is holding him back from fulfilling his destiny....She lost the nerve to force a bad situation yet peace abounds knowing she did the right thing by letting him go. Sometimes loving is letting go... This is profound writing folks. Profound whether of not my take on it is correct or not. Profound because it is so open to interpretation by nature. Yet it has a central theme: Dealing with loss. Answer? Carry on.... Never been to a concert before but she is coming to Ohio and I just might go and see her.', 'I don&#39;t understand people complaining about the fact that she&#39;s back to her roots. Norah has never stayed in any kind of comfort zone: Come away with me, Feels like home and Not too late explored each in a different way several genres (jazz, pop, country), while The Fall and Little broken hearts were a pretty audacious step towards different sounds. And don&#39;t forget the Featuring album which showed how an incredibly eclectic artist Norah is.

Lyrics:

I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by

I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying
""I love you""

I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh yeah

The Ed Sullivan Show was a television variety program that aired on CBS from 1948-1971. For 23 years it aired every Sunday night and played host to the world's greatest talents. The Ed Sullivan Show is well known for bringing rock n' roll music to the forefront of American culture through acts like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. The entertainers each week ranged from comedians like Joan Rivers and Rodney Dangerfield, to Broadway stars Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, to pop singers such as Bobby Darin and Petula Clark. It also frequently featured stars of Motown such as The Supremes, The Temptations, Stevie Wonder and The Jackson 5. The Ed Sullivan Show was one of the only places on American television where such a wide variety of popular culture was showcased and its legacy lives on to this day.

Lyrics:
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

He hung out with some of the greatest talents of the time, hung out with everything from steel workers to politicians and did it all with ease. He may have had his demons and downfalls but my god what a voice not to mention his phenomenal stage presence. He also had an air of approachability that celebrities rarely have. I think anyone was welcome to have a drink with him.

PASSION WORLD IS GRAMMYÂ¬Ã-WINNING VOCALIST KURT ELLING__ MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT YET

Recording features Arturo Sandoval, Sara Gazarek, Till Brâânner, Richard Galliano, the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra and the WDR Big Band and Orchestra

Passion World, the fifth Concord album (and eleventh overall) from vocalist Kurt Elling, lives up to its title on both counts. Kurt's latest is indeed his most __orldly_ album to date, as Elling casts his net far and wide, from Brazil to Ireland, Germany to France, Scotland to Cuba to Iceland. And it is indeed all about __assions_ _ the forces that shake our souls. As one of the busiest touring jazz artists, Elling has encountered these passions around the world; he has observed how the same depth of feeling is shaped in different ways by each unique culture through which it is filtered. The result is an album vibrant with diversity and variety, and at the same time a singular celebration of what makes us all human. In terms of its conceptual scope and its breadth of influences, Passion World is the most ambitious project yet from the preeminent male vocalist in jazz.

It is also Elling__ most star-studded album, featuring a small battalion of guest collaborators working in tandem with the singer__ much-traveled quintet (keyboardist Gary Versace, guitarist John McLean, bassist Clark Sommers, drummer Kendrick Scott). The guests include the brilliant veteran trumpeter Cuban âÂ©migrâÂ© Arturo Sandoval; the widely lauded young vocalist Sara Gazarek; German trumpet star Till Brâânner; French accordion virtuoso Richard Galliano; the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra and its founder-leader, saxophone savant Tommy Smith; and the world-renowned WDR Big Band and Orchestra from Germany, featuring pianist Frank Chastenier.

For most of us, __assion_ conjures up love, at its most dramatic and exotic. __hese are by and large compositions about romance,_ says Elling, a GRAMMY winner in 2009 (and ten-time GRAMMY nominee during his career). ""Romance is one of the things that most countries share, and I've noticed how different communities have their own ways of singing about love and heartbreak. So the nature of songs I have performed in France, for instance, reflects being cool when romance is done. In chanson, the French teach us the value of nonchalance. In lyrics from Cuba or Latin America there is an overwrought, almost threatening response to a broken heart, while in Brazil they sing of the love that remains after the object of love has gone. They mix happiness and sadness together and call it saudade. In Italy or Germany, the lyrics reveal the kind of statuesque and heroic, almost operatic, nature of the broken heart._",2015-11-01T11:57:17Z,0.05847884692259193,-0.5261115685106165,-0.5957846814384811,-0.5479502621606506,"['I&#39;m 18 years old and I&#39;m studying vocal jazz in an arts school! since my first year at that school, Sir Kurt Elling has been my greatest inspiration...

I was singing at the time with a Bay Area choir, OIGC, and one evening I showed up for rehearsal not knowing who you were singing with and there he was on stage. In San Francisco at the Cathedral celebrating Duke Ellington with Savion Glover. I&#39;ll never forget how shocked and starstruck I was just standing there two feet behind him. We were not to speak to the celebrities we performed with but I did sneak a picture and I&#39;m glad I did. And now just as I am about to embark on a solo healing road trip from California to Louisiana Crossing five states down to Florida to meet the country and a friend, I stumble across this beautiful song as if he wrote it just for me. Now I have my road trip song ready to go! That is exactly where I&#39;m headed, to a place where the streets have no name and the days have no time.
