`Note`: These audio instructions should not be included in your final submission or repository, once you are done wiht them, please delete the files and remove them from the website. 

## Getting Started

To begin the project, first read the instruction document ([click here](instructions/overview.qmd)). This document is also accessible from the navigation bar.

Once you’ve completed that, you can proceed with the instructions found throughout the website.

## What to Include on This Page

This is the landing page for your project. Content from this page can be reused in sections of your final report.

### Create an "About You" Page  

- Develop your "About You" page. You can reuse content from previous assignments.
- You can include the content here or on a separate page.
   - It’s recommended to create one "About You" page for all DSAN projects, with links to your various class projects.

### Create a Landing Page for Your Project  

- Summarize your topic, its significance, related work, and the questions you plan to explore.
- Draft an introduction with at least **5 research questions**. These may evolve as your project progresses, since data science is an iterative process.
- Include your data science questions on this page.

### Literature review

Once you decide on a topic, you should `ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW`, this is particularly important for academic projects.

The literature review is the most important part of most projects. 

It allows you to; 

* 1. Determine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you `don't re-invent the wheel`.
* 2. It makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to `ask the right questions`, `target impactful projects`, and `communicate with other professionals`.

> Doing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980's, isn't a great use of time.

In this section, please do a literature review and cite at least **3 academic publications** per group member, and include **internal academic citations**.

**Optional**: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more

By following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.

1. **Expand Your Literature Search**  
   Aim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.

2. **Skim the Abstracts**  
   Read the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.

3. **Use LLM Tools for Summarization**  
   Upload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.

4. **Leverage Interactive LLM Tools**  
   Use tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:
   - Example questions:
     - "In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?"
     - "Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?"
   These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers.


## Additional Ideas for things to include 

- **Audience**: Who is this for? Data professionals, businesses, researchers, or curious readers.
- **Headline**: A captivating title introducing the data science theme (e.g., "Unlocking Insights Through Data Stories").
- **Introduction**: A brief, engaging overview of what the website offers (e.g., data-driven stories, insights, or case studies).
- **Questions You Are Addressing**: What do you hope to learn?
- **Motivation**: Explain why this topic matters, highlighting the importance of data in solving real-world problems.
- **Key Topics**: List the main focus areas (e.g., machine learning, data visualization, predictive modeling).
- **Use Cases/Examples**: A brief teaser of compelling stories or case studies you’ve worked on.
- **Call to Action**: Invite visitors to explore the content, follow along, or contact you for more information.
- **Visual/Infographic**: Add a simple graphic or visual element to make the page more dynamic.

# Exploring YouTube Video Popularity through Data Science  
## Project Summary

The aim of this project is to analyze the popularity of YouTube's music video with Youtube's mv features, combined with the corresponding Spotify's artist popularity and and the corresponding track popularity and explore these features and YouTube music videos' popularity through regression analysis, binary and multiclassification analyses, unsupervised learning, interaction rate, etc.

## Research Questions
* Is there a relationship between video features (such as mean sentiment score，comment count, subscriber count, and publishing time) and YouTube video views?
* How can we predict YouTube video views based on Spotify's singer popularity and track popularity?
* How can sentiment analysis (sentiment score range: -0.5 to 0.2) help evaluate the interaction level between the video and its audience?
* How can we predict the Like/View ratio (engagement rate) based on video features such as comment count, duration_seconds, etc.?
* How do video features like mean sentiment score impact the likelihood of a video receiving high views?
