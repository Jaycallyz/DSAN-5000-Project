# Exploring YouTube Video Popularity through Data Science  
## Project Summary

The aim of this project is to analyze the popularity of YouTube's music video with Youtube's mv features, combined with the corresponding Spotify's artist popularity and and the corresponding track popularity and explore these features and YouTube music videos' popularity through regression analysis, binary and multiclassification analyses, unsupervised learning, interaction rate, etc.

## Research Questions
* Is there a relationship between video features (such as mean sentiment score，comment count, subscriber count, and publishing time) and YouTube video views?
* How can we predict YouTube video views based on Spotify's singer popularity and track popularity?
* How can sentiment analysis (sentiment score range: -0.5 to 0.2) help evaluate the interaction level between the video and its audience?
* How can we predict the Like/View ratio (engagement rate) based on video features such as comment count, duration_seconds, etc.?
* How do video features like mean sentiment score impact the likelihood of a video receiving high views?

## Literature Review

In recent years, the rapid expansion of video-sharing platforms like Youtube has triggered a wide range of research aimed at understanding the factors that influence video popularity, viewer engagement, and content analysis. Lots of studies have explored different aspects of YouTube dynamics, such as the discovery of persistent tags and trending videos, to better understand user behavior.

Dokuz (2024) proposed a method for identifying popular and persistent tags from a dataset of trending videos on YouTube, revealing trends in the user-video relationship and how video tags influence YouTube comments for engagement and visibility analysis, which is also a prominent area of research as it provides valuable insights into viewers' reactions and opinions about video content.Khin Nyunt and Naw Thiri Khin (2024) investigated how the combination of sentiment analysis and trend analysis can guide aspiring youtube users to choose a successful career path.Similaet al. (2024) focused on sentiment analysis techniques applied to YouTube comments to provide valuable insights into users' opinions on videos. Their study highlights how sentiment analysis can be used to predict video performance, as positive sentiment is often associated with higher engagement.

Additionally, artificial intelligence and deep learning are becoming more prevalent in analyzing YouTube comments.Meghana (2024) provides a comprehensive overview of sentiment analysis techniques, evaluating how advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) can improve the accuracy of sentiment categorization and address challenges such as multi-lingual comments and context sensitivity. These studies help to understand how content features and user responses interact to shape the success of YouTube videos.
