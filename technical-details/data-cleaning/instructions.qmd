# Instructions 

`Note`: You should remove these instructions once you have read and understood them. They should not be included in your final submission.

`Remember:` Exactly what do you on this page will be specific you your project and data. Some things might "make more sense" on other pages, depending on your workflow, for example, you might feel that normalization and scaling should be included in a later section, dealing with machine learning, rather than here, that is totally fine. Organize your project in the way that makes the most sense to you.  

## Suggested page structure

Hereâ€™s one suggested structure for organizing your technical pages. You can adjust this as needed:

`Audience`:Remember that these are written for a technical audience. Assume they have completed the DSAN program, but would appreciate refreshers of the important concepts. 

- **Introduction and Motivation:** Briefly outline your plan. What are you doing on this page, and why? Provide context and explain the goals of your analysis.
- **Overview of Methods:** Give a concise explanation of the methods used. For example, if using K-Means clustering, describe what it is, how it works, the inputs and outputs, and key hyperparameters.
- **Code:** Include the code you used to implement your workflow.
- **Summary and Interpretation of Results:** Summarize your findings, interpret the results, and discuss their technical implications.

## General comments:

- **Iterative Process**: Data cleaning is often not a one-time process. As your analysis progresses, you may need to revisit the cleaning phase, and re-run the code, to adjust to new insights or requirements.
- **Clarity and Reproducibility**: Ensure your documentation is clear and thorough. Others should be able to follow your steps and achieve the same results.
- **Visualizations**: Use before-and-after visualizations to illustrate the impact of your cleaning steps, making the process more intuitive and transparent.

By the end of this phase, your cleaned data should be well-documented and ready for further stages, such as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning**.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Documentation

## Introduction and Motivation
This document outlines the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data from a dataset containing view/like/comment counts, relevant comments and populariy value from Spotify and YouTube. The primary goal is to prepare the data for sentiment analysis and further statistical modeling, focusing on extracting meaningful insights about song popularity and engagement.

## Overview of Methods
The methods used include text cleaning, language detection, sentiment analysis, data transformation, and normalization. These techniques ensure that the data is in an appropriate format for analysis, removing any inconsistencies and ensuring quality and accuracy in the results.

## Code Implementation and Description

### Data Reading
The raw data is loaded from a CSV file using Pandas, which provides a convenient framework for data manipulation in Python.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../../data/raw-data/spotify_youtube.csv', encoding='iso-8859-1')
df.head()
```

### Comment Cleaning and Language Filtering
Comments are cleaned by removing HTML tags, punctuation, numbers, and ensuring they are in English. This is crucial for the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.

```python
def clean_comments(comments):
    # Cleaning code here...
    return english_comments
```

### Sentiment Analysis
Using NLTK's VADER, we perform sentiment analysis on the cleaned English comments. This provides a mean sentiment score for each record, indicating the overall sentiment of the comments associated with each song.

```python
def average_sentiment_score(comments):
    # Sentiment analysis code here...
    return score
```

### Data Transformations
Several transformations are applied to the dataset:
- Converting video duration from ISO 8601 format to seconds.
- Binary encoding of video definition (HD or SD).
- Factorizing the 'genre' column to prepare for modeling.

```python
df['Duration_seconds'] = df['Duration'].apply(duration_to_seconds)
df['Definition'] = df['Definition'].apply(convert_definition)
df['genre_label'] = pd.factorize(df['genre'])[0]
```

For future analysis, some categorical variables are converted into numerical style.

### Data Normalization
Using `StandardScaler`, numerical columns are scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. This step is important for models that are sensitive to the magnitude of input features.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[columns_to_scale] = scaler.fit_transform(df[columns_to_scale])
```

### Before-and-After Visualizations
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the normalized data
df_normalized = pd.read_csv('../../data/processed-data/Normalized_Data_with_Sentiments.csv')

def plot_data_comparisons(df_original, df_normalized, column_name):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))
    
    # Original Data Histogram
    sns.histplot(df_original[column_name], ax=axes[0], kde=True, color='skyblue')
    axes[0].set_title(f'Original {column_name}')
    
    # Normalized Data Histogram
    sns.histplot(df_normalized[column_name], ax=axes[1], kde=True, color='olive')
    axes[1].set_title(f'Normalized {column_name}')
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Assuming the original data is still available and named df
df_original = pd.read_csv('../../data/raw-data/spotify_youtube.csv', encoding='iso-8859-1')

# Example variables to visualize
variables_to_visualize = ['View Count', 'Like Count', 'Subscriber Count']

for variable in variables_to_visualize:
    plot_data_comparisons(df_original, df_normalized, variable)
```

### Data Storage
The processed data is saved back to a CSV file, ensuring that all modifications are preserved for subsequent analysis.
```python
df.to_csv('../../data/processed-data/Normalized_Data_with_Sentiments.csv', index=False)
```

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('../../data/processed-data/Normalized_Data_with_Sentiments.csv')
df.head()
```
