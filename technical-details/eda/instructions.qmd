# Introduction and Motivation

This eda section focuses primarily on examining the relationship between track popularity, mv's view count and youtube related factors. By analyzing the trends and correlations between these variables, we want to find which YouTube factors have a significant impact on Spotify track popularity,view count? This analysis can help us better understand the cross-platform interaction mechanism of the music market and provide data support for music promotion strategies.

# Overview of Methods

For Univariate Analysis, 
we use summary statistics to provide an overview of central tendencies and spread. Distributions were visualized using histograms with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) overlays for key metrics such as the logarithm of View Count, like_ratio, comment_ratio and singer_popularity. For categorical variables, the distribution of music genres is examined using a bar plot, highlighting the frequency of each genre.

For Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis,
we employ correlation analysis, visualization, and statistical summarization to explore relationships in the dataset. It calculates a correlation matrix to identify linear relationships between numerical variables and uses a heatmap for visualization. Scatterplots analyze pairwise relationships like logarithmic popularity and like count, days since published and subscriber count, and engagement rate versus duration, with genre as a categorical hue. A boxplot examines the distribution of singer popularity across genres. Cross-tabulation categorizes singer popularity into three levels (low, medium, high) and calculates genre-wise percentages, while groupby summarization provides mean values of key metrics by genre. 

For Data Distribution and Normalization,
We use skewness and kurtosis to assess the distribution of numeric variables. For heavily skewed data, log transformation was applied to reduce skewness. Normalization techniques were implemented, including Min-Max scaling to scale values between 0 and 1 and Z-score normalization to standardize data with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The impact of these transformations was visualized using histograms for original, Min-Max scaled, and Z-score normalized distributions, highlighting changes in data distribution.

For Statistical Insights,
Our method includes ANOVA and T-tests. One-way ANOVA was applied to compare means of 'View Count' across different genres, 'Popularity' across various durations, and 'View Count' across like ratio bins, providing F-statistics and p-values to assess significant differences. Additionally, a T-test was conducted to evaluate'View Count' based on the median of 'Mean Sentiment Score.'

For Visual Summary,
An engagement rate was calculated as the combined percentage of likes and comments relative to views. To explore relationships, scatter plots with regression lines were used to assess the correlation between popularity and likes, while a box plot examined engagement rates across genres. A violin plot visualized the distribution of sentiment scores by genre, and a scatter plot highlighted the relationship between video duration and views, categorized by genre.
